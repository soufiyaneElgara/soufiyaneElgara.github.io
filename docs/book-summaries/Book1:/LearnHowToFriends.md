## Lesson I: *Don't Criticize, Condemn, or Complain*

1. Criticism is Dangerous
	- It puts people on the defensive
	- It Wounds their pride and sense of importance 
	- It arouses resentment & only creates temporary changes

1. Beware of criticizing someone, instead of solving the problems, you will only amplify them.
1. Instead if accusing and criticizing people, try to understand them, try to see things from their perspective. This will breed sympathy, tolerance and kindness.
1. It's easier for people to accept criticism after they're received positive feedback. So when you must criticize start with a complement and then provide constructive criticism gently and tactfully.

## Lesson II: *If You Want People To Like You, Become Genuinely Interested In Them!*

1. The easiest way to make friends is become interested in others, instead of trying to make others become interested in you.
1. People are not really interested in you or me. They are mainly interested in themselves.
1. If We're trying too hard to impress people and get interested in us, we will never have many real, sincere friends.
1. Greet people with animation & enthusiasm! Say "HELLO" in a tone voice that exudes interest. Be altruistic. Do things for them that require you time, energy and consideration.
1. Don't hesitate to show interest in others
1. Before asking someone to do something for you, give them the opportunity to talk about their passions, they'll be very excited to do this, and you'll be able to leverage that enthusiasm and positive energy to ask for what you want.

## Lesson III: *Be A Good Listener. Encourage Others To Talk About Themselves!*

1. One can easily make friends by becoming interested in others. Well, being a good listener is a huge of interests.
1. Being a patient, sympathetic listener is just as important in a individual's personal life as in business.
1. Be an attentive listener! Show genuine interest by asking questions that will enjoy answering, encourage them to talk about themselves, their goals and their accomplishments.
1. Do not talk incessantly about yourself, interrupt others when they have something to say.
1. You should do 25% talking, 75% listening.

## Lesson IV: *To Win Someone To Your Way Of Thinking, Get Them To Say YES Immediately* 

1. Don't begin by discussing the things on which you disagree. Find common ground and emphasize the things on which you agree.
1. Get people to say "YES!" right at the beginning, keep them from saying "NO!"
1. When someone says "NO!", their ego compels them to remain consistent with themselves and stick to it.
1. You need to get a number of "YESES" responses and move the listeners in the affirmative direction. The "YESES" you can induce, the more likely you are to capture the attention for your ultimate proposal. 
1. Next time you find yourself trying to persuade someone, get them to agree with you and say "YES" to at least 2 things before you each share your perspectives.

## Lesson V: *Ask Question Instead Of Giving Direct Orders*

Don't forcefully tell people to do , ask them questions that will make them want to do what you expect them to do.

## Lesson VI: *Show Respect For The Other Person's Opinions. Don't Tell Them That They're Wrong!*

1. You can tell someone thy are wrong, by a look or a gesture as easily as you can with words, be ware thought.
1. Telling people they are wrong sends a direct blow to their judgment, intelligence, pride, and self-respect. That will never make them agree with you, it would only make them want to strike back.
1. It's hard to change people's mind. So don't make it harder by telling them they're wrong. If you're  going to correct them, do it subtly, so subtly that no one knows you are doing it.
1. Most of us tend to be prejudiced, biased, and suspicious when it comes to seeing things from a different point of view. When we are wrong, we might admit it to ourselves. And if we are handled gently, with tactics and diplomacy, we may admit it to others as well, but not if someone is trying to push the unpleasant truth down throat. 

## Lesson VII: *Every Time You're The One Who's Wrong, Admit It Quickly And Emphatically*

1. Acknowledge your mistakes and admit them before your opponent gets the chance to do it. A kind, forgiving attitude will be taken and your errors will be minimized.

1. Admitting you error:
	* Shatters any feeling of guilt and defensiveness.
	* Helps fix problem created by by the error.

1. When you are right, try to win people over gently and tactfully. When you are wrong, admit it readily. Its much more effective than trying to defend yourself.

## Lesson VIII: *Use Encouragement To Empower The Other Person!* 

1. If you tell someone they are stupid or dump at a certain thing, has no gift for it, and is doing it totally wrong, you will destroy almost every incentive for that person to change or improve.
1. But if you encourage them and let them know that you trust their ability to do that particular thing or change for better. They won't stop until manage to excel.
1. Rather than telling someone their goal is out of reach, try to encourage small victories. This will provide both guidance and inspiration, encouraging and praising progress through various incentives or rewards can go a long way!

## Lesson IX: *Talk In Term Of The Other Persons Interest. Make Them feel Happy About Doing Thing You Suggest.*

1. People are more likely to cooperate or fulfill your requests if you can show them the benefits in doing so.
1. How to do it:
	* Don't be selfish.
	* Focus in the other persons interests too.
	* Think about the benefits the benefits the other person should get doing what you suggest.

1. When you make you request, put it in a way that will convey how it will benefit the other person.
1. Be honest. Do not promise anything you can not deliver. If anything, it's better to promise less and deliver more.
