	* During sleep, the brain get rid of this poisons.
	* The sleep, tidies up ideas and concepts that you learn.
	* The sleep erases the less important parts of memories and simultaneously strengthens areas that you need or want to remember.
	* Sleep enhance creativity, problem solving, and cognitive flexibility.

### Procrastination

Is the action of unnecessarily and voluntarily delaying or postponing something despite knowing that there will be negative consequences for doing so.

1. How the procrastination works?
	1. Unhappy

1. What is **Recall**?

It is a learning technique that involves retrieving information from memory in order to to strengthen building chunks and enhanced deep learning.

### Learning
1. The Best Methods to learn?
	1. Combine Recall and spaced repetition : **Retrieval Practice**
	1. Be motivated
