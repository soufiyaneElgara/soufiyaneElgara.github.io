1. What is **aspect** in Grammar?

We use verbs to communicate actions. We also express their timing in the present, past, or future through their tense, ex: practice, practiced, will practice.

Beyond establishing timing, we further treat verbs to indicate their open or closed nature within their tense. In other words, how does the action **extend** or **not extend** during a particular time? In English, this is determined by the aspect of a verb.

Where tense tells us when an action **occurs**, the aspect further informs us about **the action's duration**. For example, if it started in the past, is it still acting in the present, or did it act for a while and then stop before the present.

## Verbs: Four Aspects

Verbs have four aspects: simple, perfect, progressive, and perfect progressive. 

#### Simple aspect 

* Simple aspect states an action without indicating its length of time or continuation. 

	!!! Example
              Jameson practiced shooting baskets.
 

#### Progressive aspect

* Progressive aspect communicates a continuing action:
	

	!!! Example
		Jameson is practicing shooting baskets because he wants to be a better scorer .


#### Perfect aspect

* Perfect aspect describes the relation between an earlier action and a later time:

	!!! Example 
		Jameson has practiced shooting baskets because he wants to be a better scorer. 

#### Perfect progressive aspect

* Perfect progressive aspect expresses a past ongoing action that may be complete or incomplete before another suggested or identified time:

	!!! Example
		Jameson has been practicing shooting baskets to prepare for tonight's game.

## Another view of Grammatical Aspect

* Some grammar resources might also observe verb aspect as two categories rather than four: **Perfective** and **Imperfective**. 

* Within these condensed classifications, **simple**, and **perfect aspect** would fall under **perfective aspect**, and **progressive** and **perfect progressive** aspect would be grouped with **imperfective aspect**. 

* <u>**Perfective aspect** </u> (simple, perfect) signifies an action with a ***sense of completion or containment***.

	!!! Examples
		has practiced, had practiced, will have practiced. 
		(It does not convey a low or extension of time or maintained activity) 

* <u>**Imperfective aspect**</u> (progressive, perfect progressive) **describes an action that continues or repeats** within its tense: is practicing, was practicing, had been practicing. It applies to events that are happening, have happened, or will happen.
