## Linked in 

Analysing Your profile :

1.  `open to work` symbol : Has advantages and disadvantages (pros and cons)? 
    * Pros is it helps the recruiters to find you, based on the algorithm in Linkedin 
    * Cons: It hurts you image it makes desperate for work 
    * The solution is to to let the badge "open to work " tow days and remove for the 5 days .
    * Using this technique will steel get the benefits of the algorithm and you have a nice picture .

1. For the photos
   1. It necessity to make a photo in the background. You should not left empty (the picture should )
   1. For you personnel photo (I suggest to change it, and don't take a photo yourself, go to a photographer and take a professional photo just tell him I want a linked photo  ) and you should be smiling hhh.

1. For the tile of your work, I want to put keywords related to you domain . For example: software that you work with (in general put key words of the competence  needed for the role you are searching for )

1. Add the about section (includes keywords related to you domain )

1. Experience 
   * Give an example 
   * Try to full the experience with keywords (because it the recruiters to reach you and appear in their research ). 


1. The most important things 
   1. You should post 2 times a week (to get engagement so that Linkedin gives you a push), and you will start getting notice 
   *  Just post about what you are learning (either in related to you domain or any things else, what is important is to get engagement )
   1. Make connections (you have only 200 connection), you need to follow people who are working on the companies that you are applying for. Be friends with them, and don't send a  empty request (always send a message).

If you apply this after 2 Months you will notice the results

   * do you taking action or not 

1. billionaires should not exist?
   * No should exist, because they give more value comparing to poor people 
   * 
1. economy is rigged?
   * what i think is that rich people take a hight risk that's why they get hight reword (because they a business man risk his savings and he works 24 h)
   * And for the just a simple employee they are in comfort zone (they have a specific role, specific working hours ...) that's why they are poor.
   * low is written to encourage investment (that why their is a lot of wholes especially )

1. I worried where my next meal would come from? 

1. What do you think is the problem in the income that is too low or in the habits (addiction...)?

1. The difference between the mentality and mindset between rich and poor?
   * If a poor guy is paid the minimum wedge, he will put minimum effort, but rich guy will put maximum effort to get promoted
   * Rich people they know the economic game (they save money, they invest and they take risk and they work hard and mostly they really wont to be rich ) for poor people they don't have goals they don't know the game (i mean they don't study and make search) that the difference .

1. Do you think more money more problems ?
   * I believe that problems always gonna exist either you are poor or rich, the difference is in the type of your problems and also on the impact degree of those problems.
