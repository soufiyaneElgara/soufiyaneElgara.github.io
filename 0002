### What is Gitub❓

- online service that host our project.
- share our code with other developers.
- developers can download the projects and work on theme.
- they can re-upload their edits and marge them with the main code base.
  
### what is token ❓

- personnel access token are alternative to using password for authentification to github when using CLI or github API
- a token is no different from a password except:
- it's near-guarnteed to never used else where
- it's guaranteed to have high entropy
- it's scope is more limited than an account-wide password
- in shurt, Github took things out of the hand of users, because users make poor security descisions.

### What is Forking & contributing

- Forking is aproccess when you copy a repo that is owned by someone else and he made it public to your forked repos.

#### How to create and manage a project on Github ❓

1. **First scenario**: you are building the project for the first time

- create a repo
- copy the URL of you repo
- go to you terminal: `git clone URL`
- after any change and committing the project you can update the project on github: `git push URL master`(mater or main)
- ingeneral when you clone the github creats an alias to the URL to verify: `git remote -v` so to update you type only : `git push origin main`(you need a username of your github, and token)

```bash
git clone https/... #copy the project(files) in my local machine
git remote -v #to display the alias of the url
git push url main #update the project with url
git push origin main #ipdate the project withe the alias

```

2. **secund scenario**: you have an exiting project in your local pc

- you should create a repo, withe the exact name as your project
- copy the link to the repo
- go to terminel
- verify if everthing is commited `git status`
- then push to github : `git push URL main` 
- you can create an alyas to the URL : `git remote add origin URL`
- then send:`git push origin main`

1. collaborating on a team

- colaboration, means how to work with github on a teame
- first we sopose we have project on git hub
- after workin on the project localy make sur to update from th remote: `git pull origin main`
- create a new branch for the new feature, never work directly on the main(master) : `git checkout -b feature-1` #this commande create and move at the same time to the branch
- send the new branch: `git push origin feature-1`
- then i create a pull request, my work need to approved and reviewd by team members or the manger, only than i can marge the brange to main or the master

- How to fork ❓
  - click 'fork' in the priginal repo
  - in your forked repo, click the colone or download button
  - copy the git link : `git clone URL`
  - How to update from the originlas?
  - `git remote add upstream <origin-repo-add>`
  - `git fetch upstream`  
  - `git pull upstream master`: to update the local master
  - Whay to submit a pull request?
  - once you have made changes to your fork, you can request for those changes to be marged into the original project.

## fetch vs pull

1. fetch vs pull
   - both are used to download new data from a remote repo
   1. fetch `git fetch origin`
      - git fetch really only downloads new data from a remote repo, but it doesn't integrate this new data into your working files
      - fetch is a greate for getting first view on all things that happend in a remote repo
   2. pull `git pull origin master`
      - git pull, in contrast, is used with a different goal in lined: to update your corrent HEAD branch with the latest changes from the remote server.
