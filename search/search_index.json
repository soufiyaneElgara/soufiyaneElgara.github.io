Instead if accusing and criticizing people, try to understand them, try to see things from their perspective. This will breed sympathy, tolerance and kindness. It's easier for people to accept criticism after they're received positive feedback. So when you must criticize start with a complement and then provide constructive criticism gently and tactfully. Lesson II: If You Want People To Like You, Become Genuinely Interested In Them! # The easiest way to make friends is become interested in others, instead of trying to make others become interested in you. People are not really interested in you or me. They are mainly interested in themselves. If We're trying too hard to impress people and get interested in us, we will never have many real, sincere friends. Greet people with animation & enthusiasm! Say \"HELLO\" in a tone voice that exudes interest. Be altruistic. Do things for them that require you time, energy and consideration. Don't hesitate to show interest in others Before asking someone to do something for you, give them the opportunity to talk about their passions, they'll be very excited to do this, and you'll be able to leverage that enthusiasm and positive energy to ask for what you want. Lesson III: Be A Good Listener. Encourage Others To Talk About Themselves! # One can easily make friends by becoming interested in others. Well, being a good listener is a huge of interests. Being a patient, sympathetic listener is just as important in a individual's personal life as in business. Be an attentive listener! Show genuine interest by asking questions that will enjoy answering, encourage them to talk about themselves, their goals and their accomplishments. Do not talk incessantly about yourself, interrupt others when they have something to say. You should do 25% talking, 75% listening. Lesson IV: To Win Someone To Your Way Of Thinking, Get Them To Say YES Immediately # Don't begin by discussing the things on which you disagree. Find common ground and emphasize the things on which you agree. Get people to say \"YES!\" right at the beginning, keep them from saying \"NO!\" When someone says \"NO!\", their ego compels them to remain consistent with themselves and stick to it. You need to get a number of \"YESES\" responses and move the listeners in the affirmative direction. The \"YESES\" you can induce, the more likely you are to capture the attention for your ultimate proposal. Next time you find yourself trying to persuade someone, get them to agree with you and say \"YES\" to at least 2 things before you each share your perspectives. Lesson V: Ask Question Instead Of Giving Direct Orders # Don't forcefully tell people to do , ask them questions that will make them want to do what you expect them to do. Lesson VI: Show Respect For The Other Person's Opinions. Don't Tell Them That They're Wrong! # You can tell someone thy are wrong, by a look or a gesture as easily as you can with words, be ware thought. Telling people they are wrong sends a direct blow to their judgment, intelligence, pride, and self-respect. That will never make them agree with you, it would only make them want to strike back. It's hard to change people's mind. So don't make it harder by telling them they're wrong. If you're going to correct them, do it subtly, so subtly that no one knows you are doing it. Most of us tend to be prejudiced, biased, and suspicious when it comes to seeing things from a different point of view. When we are wrong, we might admit it to ourselves. And if we are handled gently, with tactics and diplomacy, we may admit it to others as well, but not if someone is trying to push the unpleasant truth down throat. Lesson VII: Every Time You're The One Who's Wrong, Admit It Quickly And Emphatically # Acknowledge your mistakes and admit them before your opponent gets the chance to do it. A kind, forgiving attitude will be taken and your errors will be minimized. Admitting you error: Shatters any feeling of guilt and defensiveness. Helps fix problem created by by the error. When you are right, try to win people over gently and tactfully. When you are wrong, admit it readily. Its much more effective than trying to defend yourself. Lesson VIII: Use Encouragement To Empower The Other Person! # If you tell someone they are stupid or dump at a certain thing, has no gift for it, and is doing it totally wrong, you will destroy almost every incentive for that person to change or improve. But if you encourage them and let them know that you trust their ability to do that particular thing or change for better. They won't stop until manage to excel. Rather than telling someone their goal is out of reach, try to encourage small victories. This will provide both guidance and inspiration, encouraging and praising progress through various incentives or rewards can go a long way! Lesson IX: Talk In Term Of The Other Persons Interest. Make Them feel Happy About Doing Thing You Suggest. # People are more likely to cooperate or fulfill your requests if you can show them the benefits in doing so. How to do it: Don't be selfish. Focus in the other persons interests too. Think about the benefits the benefits the other person should get doing what you suggest. When you make you request, put it in a way that will convey how it will benefit the other person. Be honest. Do not promise anything you can not deliver. If anything, it's better to promise less and deliver more.","title":"Learn How To Winn Friends And Influence Peope"},{"location":"book-summaries/book1-LearnHowToWinFriendsAnsInflunecePeople/#learn-how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people","text":"By : Dale Carnegie","title":"Learn How To Win Friends And Influence People"},{"location":"book-summaries/book1-LearnHowToWinFriendsAnsInflunecePeople/#lesson-i-dont-criticize-condemn-or-complain","text":"Criticism is Dangerous It puts people on the defensive It Wounds their pride and sense of importance It arouses resentment & only creates temporary changes Beware of criticizing someone, instead of solving the problems, you will only amplify them.

Learning is the process of acquiring new knowledge, skills, behaviors, or attitudes through experience, study or instruction. It involves making connections between different pieces of information and forming a deep understanding of how things work. How Our Brain Learn? During Waking : During Waking hours, the brain is constantly processing informations and making new connections. During Sleep : During sleep, the brain consolidates and strengthens memories, as well as processes new information learned during the wake(The most heavy thinking is done unconscious) What Are The Modes Of Thinking? Focused Mode Is a state of deep concentration and intense mental focus on a particular task or activity. It allows you to work efficiently and effectively on a single task without getting sidetracked by other thoughts or distractions. Diffuse Mode Is a state of mind in which your brain is relaxed and not focused on a particular task (sleep or exercise), allowing you to make connections and generate creative ideas subconsciously. Module 2: Memory, Sleep and Procrastination # Memory # Different Types of Memory? Working Memory Is the part of memory that has to do with what you're immediately and consciously processing in your mind. It can only holds (04) four chunks of information. Long Term Memory : It's like a storage warehouse. Long term memory is durable yet changeable; What is the best method to move things from working to long term memory? Using Spaced Repetition , which is a memory technique that involves reviewing and recalling information at optimal spacing intervals until the information is learned at a sufficient level. Advices related to learning: Practice make things permanent. Doing a little every day is better than all at once. Doing physical exercise is an important item in the process of learning. Sleep # How our sleep effect our learning? Just plain being awake creates toxics products in your brain (Metabolic toxins). During sleep, the brain get rid of this poisons. The sleep, tidies up ideas and concepts that you learn. The sleep erases the less important parts of memories and simultaneously strengthens areas that you need or want to remember. Sleep enhance creativity, problem solving, and cognitive flexibility. Procrastination # What is procrastination? Is the action of unnecessarily and voluntarily delaying or postponing something despite knowing that there will be negative consequences for doing so. How the procrastination works? Unhappy You funnel attention to a more pleasure task (watching mobile...) Feel happy temporarily How to overcome procrastination? Set a timer for 25min (Pomodor Technique). Be very focus in this 25min. Take 5min Brake. Reward your Self. Module 3: Chunks, Illusions, Learning # Chunks # What is chunks? Chunks is a cognitive process that involves grouping or organizing pieces of information together in a way that makes easier to remember or process. How to form a chunk? Focused attention. Understanding (the concept (how), context (when)). Practice. The important of library of chunks? Helps to be more creative (Using diffuse, by connecting different chunks) Helps understand new chunks (Using transfer old learned concept to the new ones) Illusion of competence # What is illusion of competence in learning? It's a phenomenon where individuals overestimate their level of understanding or mastery of a subject, despite their actual level of knowledge or skill. What causes this phenomenon? It caused due to relaying on some external storage of information, like a book or google for example. The solution to this illusion? Use Recall method What is Recall ? It is a learning technique that involves retrieving information from memory in order to to strengthen building chunks and enhanced deep learning. Learning # The Best Methods to learn? Combine Recall and spaced repetition : Retrieval Practice Be motivated Overlearning Interleaving Deliberate practice Try to create a vivid concepts for an abstract topics. Try to do explanation (Explain to some thing or some one) Find a community The best app for it is Anki What is Overlearning ? Is a Learning Technique that involves practicing a skill or information beyond the point of mastery. It is a process of continuing to practice and reinforce a skill or information even after it has been learned to a satisfactory level. What is Interleaving ? Cognitive strategy that involves alternating between different types of tasks or concepts during practice or learning. It involves switching between related topics or skills in a systematic way It helps to develop more flexible and adaptive problem solving skills. it reduce the effects of forgetting and improving long term retention of information. What is Deliberate Practice ? Is a type of learning that involves highly focused and intentional efforts to improve performance in a particular skill or domain, it includes: Focus on a specific goal: Set a specific challenging goals.

The best gift to give your mind is Exercise Use the metaphors and visualization to understand and remember concepts Always change your thought (Learning) to change your brain Try to learn your subjects every day for small amount of time, is better than big tile for a single subject each day. Turn some concepts (wanted to learn) to be remember using the help of relating it with a picture. For Anki: Before sleep and in the very morning. Important advices: In a test: look at all questions Start withe the hard question (give your subconscious a mission) for a moment than switch to easy ones. In writing Answer this questions for better writing: What Am I Trying To Say? What I Must Not Leave Out? Be clear, the more clear and concious, the more impressive you are. Always separate the editing from writing. Always short sentences are better than long ones. Module 4 : Zombie Mode # What is zombie mode? The zombie mode is the state( routine) where you start doing something (learning...) without thinking so much on how to do it, it only comes fluently. The zombie mode is a great technique to avoid procrastination and free the slots in the front of the head. The secret to improve the zombie mode is to change our habits.

Before I tell what is in the program for today, I want to ask you : 1. Do you listen to the audios that I provide you ? How do you find them? 1. Do you use you Anki ? 1. Did you do a summery of any book ? What we are gonna do to day? You are gonna do a test, I takes only 10 mins, And it gives you a glance on you level https://www.examenglish.com/leveltest/grammar_level_test.htm The goal is to keep track of you level, is it increasing or not? We are gonna have to an open discussion on two subjects : Traveling and \"the video I sent you \" How you can Enhance you linked In : Linked in # Analysing Your profile : open to work symbol : Has advantages and disadvantages (pros and cons)? Pros is it helps the recruiters to find you, based on the algorithm in Linkedin Cons: It hurts you image it makes desperate for work The solution is to to let the badge \"open to work \" tow days and remove for the 5 days . Using this technique will steel get the benefits of the algorithm and you have a nice picture . For the photos It necessity to make a photo in the background. You should not left empty (the picture should ) For you personnel photo (I suggest to change it, and don't take a photo yourself, go to a photographer and take a professional photo just tell him I want a linked photo ) and you should be smiling hhh. For the tile of your work, I want to put keywords related to you domain . For example: software that you work with (in general put key words of the competence needed for the role you are searching for ) Add the about section (includes keywords related to you domain ) Experience Give an example Try to full the experience with keywords (because it the recruiters to reach you and appear in their research ). The most important things You should post 2 times a week (to get engagement so that Linkedin gives you a push), and you will start getting notice Just post about what you are learning (either in related to you domain or any things else, what is important is to get engagement ) Make connections (you have only 200 connection), you need to follow people who are working on the companies that you are applying for. Be friends with them, and don't send a empty request (always send a message). If you apply this after 2 Months you will notice the results Taking the test # Discussion on the video # Being is poor is a choice ? poor is mind set since 2017, every changed, now their people have do you taking action or not billionaires should not exist? No should exist, because they give more value comparing to poor people economy is rigged? what i think is that rich people take a hight risk that's why they get hight reword (because they a business man risk his savings and he works 24 h) And for the just a simple employee they are in comfort zone (they have a specific role, specific working hours ...) that's why they are poor. low is written to encourage investment (that why their is a lot of wholes especially ) I worried where my next meal would come from? What do you think is the problem in the income that is too low or in the habits (addiction...)? The difference between the mentality and mindset between rich and poor? If a poor guy is paid the minimum wedge, he will put minimum effort, but rich guy will put maximum effort to get promoted Rich people they know the economic game (they save money, they invest and they take risk and they work hard and mostly they really wont to be rich ) for poor people they don't have goals they don't know the game (i mean they don't study and make search) that the difference . Do you think more money more problems ? I believe that problems always gonna exist either you are poor or rich, the difference is in the type of your problems and also on the impact degree of those problems. Open discussion about traveling # Reading baseball pig # do you know the difference between this words: hitter hater hatter What is an idiom? what is the difference between : grip: to hold something tightly or firmly grab: to take or seize something quickly or suddenly grub: it refers to food or eating.

We use verbs to communicate actions. We also express their timing in the present, past, or future through their tense, ex: practice, practiced, will practice. Beyond establishing timing, we further treat verbs to indicate their open or closed nature within their tense. In other words, how does the action extend or not extend during a particular time? In English, this is determined by the aspect of a verb. Where tense tells us when an action occurs , the aspect further informs us about the action's duration . For example, if it started in the past, is it still acting in the present, or did it act for a while and then stop before the present. Verbs: Four Aspects # Verbs have four aspects: simple, perfect, progressive, and perfect progressive. Simple aspect # Simple aspect states an action without indicating its length of time or continuation. Example Jameson practiced shooting baskets. Progressive aspect # Progressive aspect communicates a continuing action: Example Jameson is practicing shooting baskets because he wants to be a better scorer . Perfect aspect # Perfect aspect describes the relation between an earlier action and a later time: Example Jameson has practiced shooting baskets because he wants to be a better scorer. Perfect progressive aspect # Perfect progressive aspect expresses a past ongoing action that may be complete or incomplete before another suggested or identified time: Example Jameson has been practicing shooting baskets to prepare for tonight's game. Another view of Grammatical Aspect # Some grammar resources might also observe verb aspect as two categories rather than four: Perfective and Imperfective . Within these condensed classifications, simple , and perfect aspect would fall under perfective aspect , and progressive and perfect progressive aspect would be grouped with imperfective aspect .

The present continuous tense (also known as the present progressive ) is used to talk about an ongoing an action or situation taking place in the present moment. It emphasizes that the action is in progress and not yet completed. Structure # The present continuous tense is formed using to be in simple present + present participle ( present participle == verb + ing ). The full form or the short form of the verb to be can be used in this structure. Exmaple I am working or I'm working he/she/it is working or he's/she's/it's working We/You/They are working or we're/ You're/They're working Spelling # For the most verbs ing is added to the base form of the verb to form the present continuous tense, but when the verb ends in e , it should be removed before adding ing . Example make ---> making take \u2192 taking come \u2192 taking If the verb ends in a vowel + a consonant and the last syllable is stressed , the consonant is doubled before adding the ing Example plan \u2192 planning stop \u2192 stopping Why we don't double the letter \"t\" in the \"Eat\" verb: \"Eat\" ends in a single consonant \"t\", but it is preceded by two vowels(\"ea\"). Since there are tow vowels, the consonant is not doubled when adding \"ing\". Negation # To make a present continuous verb negative , we place not after the auxiliary verb to be verb Example I'm working \u2192 I am not working / I'm not working She is eating \u2192 She is not eating / She isn't eating They are waiting \u2192 They are not waiting / They aren't waiting. Tip Remember never to use the short form \"I amn't\". Say \"I'm not\", but fir the rest you can contrast them. Questions # For yes/no questions To make a question in the present continuous tense, use the to be verb at the beginning of the sentence before the subject and then add the ing form of the verb. Example I'm working ---> Am I working? She is eating ---> Is she eating ? For wh-question We simply place the question word at the beginning of the sentence and then form the question using the appropriate form of to be as in the present continuous. !!! Example * He is working in the morning --> When is he working? * We are meeting the at six ---> Who are we meeting ? Uses # The present continuous tense is used to talk about an ongoing action or event that is happening right now . Example I am watching a movie now. We're eating dinner right now. She is talking on the phone at the moment. The present continuous is used in many different contexts: Actions happening Now. Actions happening Not at the exact moment of speaking Temporary situations Action that are planned in the near future. annoying/complaining repeated actions Story telling and narration changes and Trends Actions Happening Now # As mentioned above, the present continuous tense is mainly used to talk about an action continuing in the present moment, and we are int the middle of an activity. And we are talking about it at the moment. Ex: * The teacher \"is going\" to the carnival right now. * The whole family \"are dancing\" at the party. What tense we choose for sport commentaries In sport commentaries when the action is happening at the moment and is in progress the present continuous tense is commonly used. However, it is usually followed by a present simple tense, ex: He \"is passing\" Christian and shoots the ball. She \"is swimming\" faster than the others ans passes the end line. Actions happening not at the exact moment of speaking # We can use the present continuous tense to talk about an action that is taking place \"around now\" but not at the exact moment of speech. This means that the action started some moments ago, is still ongoing, and is expected to continue for some more time, ex: * I \"am learning\" to drive. * We \"are fighting\" for our freedom. Temporary situation # We use the present continuous tense to talk about something that we perceive as temporary. A temporary thing does not remain the same in the long term of time. It means that it will change, but the exact timing of the change is uncertain. Ex: * I 'am living' with my sister until I find an apartment. (here, we are referring to an ongoing action that is happening but not necessarily at the exact moment of speaking ) * Ellen cannot come to the phone since she \"is sleeping\" * I'm wearing a sweet perfume. Future plans and Arrangements # Another use of the present continuous tense is to talk about future events and plans. When a decision has been made and we are sure that it will happen, we we use it, ex: * Anna \"is staying\" at her grandma's house this weekend. * Samuel and his father \"are playing\" the guitar on Christmas Eve. 1. special occasion We can use the main verb \"to have\" in the \"continuous form\" to refer to a \"special occasion\". * They \"are having\" a party next weekend to celebrate their anniversary. changes and Trends # Trends We use the present continuous tense to describe an action or a trend that is new and different from previous occurrences within its category. This highlights a contrast between the current situation and its previous counterparts: ex: These days most people \"are writing\" email instead of \"writing\" letters. What sort of music \"are\" they \"listening\" to? People \"are spending\" more time in cafes nowadays. changing and improving We use the present progressive to talk about something which is changing, growing, or improving. This means that the action is turning to another level or basis over time step by step ex: The climate \"is changing\" rapidly. You English \"is improving\". Tip: It the present continuous, can be used to tell a story and narration. NB: * Another big tip, if you find yourself confused in situations (present simple and present continuous have the same uses) that have the same uses, just look of the event, action or the situation is habit or ongoing action Annoying/complaints repeated actions # We use the present continuous tense with adverbs such as always, forever, al the time, constantly to emphasize a continuing series of repeated action that happen regularly on a repeating basis for expressing complaints (if it s not a compkaint use present simple) * They are always arguing You're constantly complaining about your mother-in-low! Story telling and narration # We can use the present continuous to narrate past event when we are telling a story. Telling a story involves summarizing or recounting events: ex * The other day I'm just walking down the street when suddenly Sam calls me and asks me to come visit her. So I'm thinking when I should go. How to choose between \"simple present\" and \"present continuous\" in a story telling? Both can be used, but they serve different purposes : Present simple : Used to narrate the main events in a clear, factual, or habitual manner. Present Progressive: Used to describe actions in progress or temporary actions happening at the same time as the lain story events When using both tenses affectively can make a story more engaging and give the reader a strong sense of what's happening in real time. These adverbs can also be used with the present continuous tense when you want to express annoyance or frustration about something that happens repeatedly. In this case, they emphasize a repeated action that the speaker finds irritating. always usually often frequently sometimes never Time expression for the present progressive: Right now At the moment Currently Today This week This month Now Nowadays Still For the time being Are the stative verbs used with present continuous? We do not normally use the continuous wit the stative verbs (also called non continuous verbs). This verbs are normally used in the simple form because they refer to states, rather than action or progress. Ex: To have, To know, to want, To cost.

A repository is a container for a project you want to track with git. A repository can allow users to store several different repo's and truck each one dependently. You can have many different repos's for many different projects on your computer. What is commits ? Git commit, creates a commit, which is like a snapshot of your repository. commits are the building blocks of a 'save points' with in git's version control. This commit are snapshots of your entire repository to a specific times. You should make new commits often, based around logical unites of change. Over time commits should tell us a story of the history of your repo and how it came to be they way it currently is. What is the commit process ? The Git committing process requires several steps: Moving Changes to the staging area and Saving them with Commit Command. The phases of a commit: Modified : Changed files not commited. Staging : Add any changed files to staging that you want to commit. Commited : Any files in the stagin area are added to the commit when we make one. What is branches \u2753 # A branch is new/separate version of the main repo. Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project, without impacting the main branch. Configuration # some basic commands in git: sudo apt install git #used to insall git on ubuntu. git --version #display the version. git config --global user.name soufiyane #to set a username to the git. git config --gloabal user.email soufiyane@gmail.com #to set an email to git. git config user.name #display the username. git config user.email #dispaly the email. How to create and manipulate repos ? Create a new repo: mkdir my-project ` #create a folder for the project cd my-project #go to the folder git init #intialize a new, empty repo here How to commit a change ? git add filename #add the changed file to the staged phase git add . #add all files to the staging phase git rm --cach filename #to remove a file from the stage phase git status #display the status file in stage phase(if add or not) git commit -m \"describ the current commit\" #now you'r committing, with a discription message git log #display all the commits in the long format git log --oneline #display all the commits in a concise format How to back and change the commits ? checkout a commit : View the commits without changing anything (read only) git checkout 3243FFD #view the all the commits specific time, without editing(read only) ``` 1 . revert a commit: Basically it can modify a commit, but it creates a new one, withe the new or deleted feature ``` bash git revert 233EDS #the reverted commit steel in the logs reset a commit: it means deleting the commit for good deleting the commit, with the possibility to recover git reset 3242ffs #stell we have the changing in the working area, to recover: git add . git commit -m \"undo the reset\" deleting for good(no chance to recover) git reset 12131 --hard #remove the commit defentlly How to manipulate branches: create new branch and move to it git bransh feature-1 # Create a new branch git branch -a # Display all the branches git checkout feature-1 # Switch to a specific branch How to delete a branch? git checkout master # You should move to master/main first git branch -d feature-1 # Delete a merged branch git branch -D feature-1 # Delete un merged branch How to merge a branch? git checkout master # Move to the branch that you want to marge in to it git merge feature-1 # Merge the feature 1 to master branch What is conflict?
