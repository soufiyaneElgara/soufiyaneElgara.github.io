### What is Git❓

- Git is free and open source for distribution version control.
- it's a system that records changes to our files over time.
- Git allows users to track code changes and manage their project using simple commands.
- we can recally specific version of those files at any given time.
- many people can easly collaborate on a project and have their ouwn version of project files on their computer.
  
### Why use Git❓

- store revisions in a project history in just one directory.
- rewined on new features in the project i wanted to.
- work on a new feature without messing up the main codeBase.
- easly collaborate with other programmers.
  
### How Git works❓

- the hart of Git is repository used to contain a project.
- What is repository ?
  - A repository is a container for a project you want to track with git.
  - A repository can allow users to store several different repo's and truck eash one idependently.
  - can have many different repos's for many different projects on your computer.
- What is commits ?
  - Git commit, creats a commit, which is like a snapshot of your repository.
  - commits are the building blocks of 'savie points' with in git's version control.
  - this commit are snapshots of your entier repository to a specific times.
  - you should make new commits often, based around logical unites of change.
  - over time commits should tell us a story of the history of your repo and how it came to be they way it currently is.
- what is the commit process ?
  - the Git committing process requires several steps: moving changes to the staging area and saving them with commit commande
  - the phases of a commit:
      1. **Modified**: changed files not commited.
      2. **Staging**: add any changed files to staging that you want to commit.
      3. **Commited**: any files in the stagin area are added to the commit when we make one.

### What is branches ❓

- a branch is new/separate version of the main repo.
- branches allow to work on different parts of a project, without impacting the main branch.

### Configuration

1. some basic commands in git:

```bash
sudo apt install git #used to insall git on ubuntu.
git --version #display the version.
git config --global user.name soufiyane #to set a username to the git.
git config --gloabal user.email soufiyane@gmail.com #to set an email to git.
git config user.name  #display the username.
git config user.email #dispaly the email.

```

1. How to create and manuplate repos ?

- create a new repo:

```bash
mkdir my-project` #create a folder for the project
cd my-project #go to the folder
git init #intialize a new, empty repo here

```

- How to commit a change ?

```bash
git add filename #add the changed file to the staged phase
git add #add all files to the staging phase
git rm --cach filename #to remove a file from the stage phase
git status #display the status file in stage phase(if add or not)
git commit -m "describ the current commit" #now you'r committing, with a discription message
git log #display all the commits in the long format
git log --oneline #display all the commits in a concise format
```

- How to back and change the commits ?

1. checkout a commit : veiw the commits without changing enething (read only)

```bash
git checkout 3243FFD #view the all the commits specific time, without cediting(read only)

 ```

1. revert a commit: baseclly it can modify a commit, but it creates a new one, withe the new or delated feature

```bash
git revert 233EDS #the reverted comit steel in log
```

1. reset a commit: it means deleting the commit for good
   1. deleting the commit, with the possiblilty to recover

```bash
git reset 3242ffs #stell we have the changing in the working area, to recover:
    git add . 
    git commit -m "undo the reset"
```

   1. deleting for good(no chance to recover)

```bash
git reset 12131 -- hard #remove the commit defentlly
```

1. How to manipulate branches:

- move d

```bash
git bransh feature-1 #create a new branch
git branch -a #display all the branches
git checkout feature-1 #switch to a specific branch
```

- How to delete a branch?

```bash
git checkout master # you should move to master/main first
git branch -d feature-1 # delete a marged branch
git branch -D feature-1 # delete un marged branch

```

- How to marge a branch?

```bash
git checkout master #move to the branch that you want to marge in to it
git marge feature-1 #marge the feature 1 to master branch
```
  
- What is conflict?
  - an example of a conflit, when you make a new brach for new feature, then after you a guy modifies in the master branch, then you need to help Git to decide which modification to keep

```bash
git marge feature-1 #pops an error, you need modifie the code
git add . #add to stagin erea
git commit` #make a commit witout a name(:wq, if a bash file is popeds)
```
