<ol>
<li>What is the <strong>present continuous tense</strong>?</li>
</ol>
<p>The present continuous tense (also known as the <strong>present progressive</strong>) is used to talk about an ongoing an action or situation taking place in the present moment. It emphasizes that the action is in progress and not yet completed.</p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#structure" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The present continuous tense is formed using <strong><em><code>to be</code> in simple present + <code>present participle</code></em></strong> ( <strong>present participle == verb + ing</strong>).
The full form or the short form of the verb <code>to be</code> can be used in this structure. </p>
<div class="admonition exmaple">
<p class="admonition-title">Exmaple</p>
<ul>
<li>I am working or I'm working</li>
<li>he/she/it is working or he's/she's/it's working   </li>
<li>We/You/They are working  or we're/ You're/They're working</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spelling">Spelling<a class="headerlink" href="#spelling" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the most verbs <code>ing</code> is added to the base form of the verb to form the present continuous tense, but when the verb ends in <code>e</code>, it should be removed before adding <code>ing</code>.</p>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<ul>
<li>make ---&gt; making</li>
<li>take &rarr; taking</li>
<li>come &rarr; taking </li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the verb ends in a <strong><code>vowel + a consonant</code></strong> and the last syllable is <strong>stressed</strong>, the consonant is <strong><em>doubled</em></strong> before adding the <code>ing</code></p>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<ul>
<li>plan &rarr; planning</li>
<li>stop &rarr; stopping </li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why we don't double the letter "t" in the "Eat" verb:
"Eat" ends in a single consonant "t", but it is preceded by two vowels("ea"). Since there are tow vowels, the consonant is not doubled when adding "ing".</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="negation">Negation<a class="headerlink" href="#negation" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To make a present continuous verb <strong>negative</strong>, we place <code>not</code> after the auxiliary verb <strong>to be</strong> verb</p>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm working   &rarr; I am not working / I'm not working</li>
<li>She is eating  &rarr; She is not eating / She isn't eating</li>
<li>They are waiting &rarr; They are not waiting / They aren't waiting.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Remember never to use the short form "I amn't". Say "I'm not", but fir the rest you can contrast them.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="questions">Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#questions" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For yes/no questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To make a <strong>question</strong> in the present continuous tense, use the <strong>to be</strong> verb at <strong><em>the beginning</em></strong> of the sentence before the <strong>subject</strong> and then add the <code>ing</code> form of the verb. </p>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm working   ---&gt; Am I working?</li>
<li>She is eating ---&gt; Is she eating ?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>For wh-question</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We simply place the <strong>question word</strong> at <strong><em>the beginning</em></strong> of the sentence and then form the question using the appropriate form of <code>to be</code> as in the present continuous.</p>
<pre><code>!!! Example
    * He is working in the morning --&gt; When is he working?
    * We are meeting the at six ---&gt; Who are we meeting ?
</code></pre>
<h2 id="uses">Uses<a class="headerlink" href="#uses" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The present continuous tense is used to talk about an <strong><em>ongoing action</em></strong> or event that is <strong><em>happening right now</em></strong>.</p>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<ul>
<li>I am watching a movie now.</li>
<li>We're eating dinner right now.</li>
<li>She is talking on the phone at the moment. </li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The present continuous is used in many different contexts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Actions happening Now.</li>
<li>Actions happening Not at the exact moment of speaking</li>
<li>Temporary situations</li>
<li>Action that are planned in  the near future.</li>
<li>annoying/complaining repeated actions</li>
<li>Story telling and narration</li>
<li>changes and Trends</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="actions-happening-now">Actions Happening Now<a class="headerlink" href="#actions-happening-now" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the present continuous tense is mainly used to talk about an action continuing in the present moment, and we are int the middle of an activity. And we are talking about it at the moment. Ex:
   * The teacher "is going" to the carnival right now.
   * The whole family "are dancing" at the party.</p>
<ol>
<li>What tense we choose for sport commentaries 
In sport commentaries when the action is happening at the moment and is in progress the present continuous tense is commonly used. However, it is usually followed by a present simple tense, ex:</li>
<li>He "is passing" Christian and shoots the ball.</li>
<li>She "is swimming" faster than the others ans passes the end line.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="actions-happening-not-at-the-exact-moment-of-speaking">Actions happening not at the exact moment of speaking<a class="headerlink" href="#actions-happening-not-at-the-exact-moment-of-speaking" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>We can use the present continuous tense to talk about an action that is taking place "around now" but not at the exact moment of speech. This means that the action started some moments ago, is still ongoing, and is expected to continue for some more time, ex:
   * I "am learning" to drive.
   * We "are fighting" for our freedom.</p>
<h3 id="temporary-situation">Temporary situation<a class="headerlink" href="#temporary-situation" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>We use the present continuous tense to talk about something that we perceive as temporary. A temporary thing does not remain the same in the long term of time. It means that it will change, but the exact timing of the change is uncertain. Ex:
    * I 'am living' with my sister until I find an apartment. (here, we are referring to an ongoing action that is happening but not necessarily  at the exact moment of speaking )
    * Ellen cannot come to the phone since she "is sleeping"
    * I'm wearing a sweet perfume.</p>
<h3 id="future-plans-and-arrangements">Future plans and Arrangements<a class="headerlink" href="#future-plans-and-arrangements" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Another use of the present continuous tense is to talk about future events and plans. When a decision has been made and we are sure that it will happen, we we use it, ex:
    * Anna "is staying" at her grandma's house this weekend.
    * Samuel and his father "are playing" the guitar on Christmas Eve.
1. special occasion 
We can use the main verb "to have" in the "continuous form" to refer to a "special occasion". 
    * They "are having" a party next weekend to celebrate their anniversary.</p>
<h3 id="changes-and-trends">changes and Trends<a class="headerlink" href="#changes-and-trends" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Trends
We use the present continuous tense to describe an action or a trend that is new and different from previous occurrences within its category. This highlights a contrast between the current situation and its previous counterparts: ex:<ul>
<li>These days most people "are writing" email instead of "writing" letters.</li>
<li>What sort of music "are" they "listening" to?</li>
<li>People "are spending" more time in cafes nowadays.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>changing and improving 
We use the present progressive to talk about something which is changing, growing, or improving. This means that the action is turning to another level or basis over time step by step ex:<ul>
<li>The climate "is changing" rapidly.</li>
<li>You English "is improving". 
Tip: It the present continuous, can be used to tell a story and narration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NB: 
* Another big tip, if you find yourself confused in situations (present simple and present continuous have the same uses) that have the same uses, just look of the event, action or the situation is habit or ongoing action</p>
<h3 id="annoyingcomplaints-repeated-actions">Annoying/complaints repeated actions<a class="headerlink" href="#annoyingcomplaints-repeated-actions" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>We use the present continuous tense with adverbs such as always, forever, al the time, constantly to emphasize a continuing series of repeated action that happen regularly on a repeating basis for expressing complaints (if it s not a compkaint use present simple)
    * They are always arguing
    You're constantly complaining about your mother-in-low!</p>
<h3 id="story-telling-and-narration">Story telling and narration<a class="headerlink" href="#story-telling-and-narration" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>We can use the present continuous to narrate past event when we are telling a story. Telling a story involves summarizing or recounting events: ex
    * The other day I'm just walking down the street when suddenly Sam calls me and asks me to come visit her. So I'm thinking when I should go.</p>
<ol>
<li>How to choose between "simple present" and "present continuous" in a story telling?</li>
<li>Both can be used, but they serve different purposes :</li>
<li>Present simple : Used to narrate the main events in a clear, factual, or habitual manner.</li>
<li>Present Progressive: Used to describe actions in progress or temporary actions happening at the same time as the lain story events</li>
<li>
<p>When using both tenses affectively can make a story more engaging and give the reader a strong sense of what's happening in real time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These adverbs can also be used with the present continuous tense when you want to express annoyance or frustration about something that happens repeatedly. In this case, they emphasize a repeated action that the speaker finds irritating.</p>
<ul>
<li>always</li>
<li>usually</li>
<li>often</li>
<li>frequently</li>
<li>sometimes</li>
<li>never</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time expression for the present progressive: </p>
<ul>
<li>Right now</li>
<li>At the moment </li>
<li>Currently</li>
<li>Today</li>
<li>This week</li>
<li>This month</li>
<li>Now</li>
<li>Nowadays</li>
<li>Still</li>
<li>For the time being </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the stative verbs used with present continuous?
We do not normally use the continuous wit the stative verbs (also called non continuous verbs). This verbs are normally used in the simple form because they refer to states, rather than action or progress. Ex: To have, To know, to want, To cost.</p>
<ul>
<li>She has three doges and a cat</li>
<li>This pizza testes wonderful. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
